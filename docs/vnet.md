## Set Network Address VMware Workstation

Go to Edit â‡¨  Virtual Network Editor

Select `vmnet8` and if necessary hit `Change Settings` to make changes.

Make sue that the subnet IP for `vmnet8` is set to `192.168.142.0`.

Then go to VM and ping `192.168.42.2` and then you should be able to ping `ping -c4 google.com`

If still, you can't ping google, make sure that the `/etc/resolv.conf` on first node is set to `192.168.142.2`

Example:

```
nameserver 192.168.142.2
domain servicemesh.local
search servicemesh.local
```

## Set Network Address in VMware Player

If you are not using VMware Workstation (it costs money), you can download VMware Player from vmware.com and install it on your Windows.

> There is no VMware Player for Mac. The only option is to use VMware Fusion.

Unfortunately, the VMware Player (free version) allows only one virtual machine per host.
